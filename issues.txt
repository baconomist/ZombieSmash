May need adjustment:
        Tomas either needs to make images to proportion/scale so he doesnt scale
        things in spine, or I write a png exporter from the running spine code
        for each limb so I can then use those pngs in rube to make accurate
        physics bodies.

        You access the scale of spine image using
        ((RegionAttachment)skeleton.findSlot(bodyName).getAttachment()).getScaleX()

Issues:
		

		Medium:
			Animation is a tiny bit smaller than physics bodies, need solution above
			which is about he adjusting etc...

			Currently, I have an offset to make spine animations a tiny bit bigger
			so the difference between physics and animation body size is small, but
			noticeable. But I cannot make spine animation size of physics bodies with
			scale because tomas did not scale proportionally. So even if I scale
			the animation, the torso will be a bit wider on the physics side.
			
		Minor:
			There is a rare glitch that happens whene you quickly grab a physics part, 
			quickly release it while tapping on the screen with another finger.(Has to be done really really fast, hard to do)
			It causes the mousejoitn to teleport to the other finger and thus the body too.
